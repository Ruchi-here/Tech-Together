## Introduction
EqualPay is a website that helps you get paid fairly for your work, regardless of gender.

EqualPay is a comprehensive platform that provides tools and resources to help people negotiate their salaries, find jobs that match their skills and experience, and achieve their career goals.

## Features
EqualPay is a website that helps you get paid fairly for your work. It has two main features:

**Customized negotiation email:** This feature helps you create a persuasive email to send to your manager when negotiating your salary or promotion. You simply need to upload your resume and a draft of your own negotiation email, and EqualPay will provide feedback and suggestions.

**Job search with filters:** This feature allows you to find jobs based on your skills, gender, experience, and other criteria. You can also filter results by salary, location, and company type.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
